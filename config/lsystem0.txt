# the number of times to iterate the system
# higher numbers yield VERY slow mapgen. 
# A number in [2, 6] is usually enough
iterations 2

# the number of turtles that draw our lsystem to the screen
# higher numbers yield denser maps

# Alphabet 
# end_key = :, fwd = f, left = l, right = r, up = u, down = d, save = [, return = ], place = p, 0 = none

# Rule form
# predicate_symbol target_symbol successor_symbol : list of symbols from the alphabet
# 
# the 0 symbol as a predicate or successor matches against any symbol (a 'wildcard')
# only if a rule that matches a specific predicate or successor is not evaluated
# e.g. with '0 f p : f', and '0 f 0 : f p', if '0 f p' matches, then '0 f 0' is not
# checked

# Axiom (just a list of symbols from our alphabet)
