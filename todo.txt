Turtle Map Gen

Pure automata with tunneling (already have tunnel_pockets)

Game::process_post_move() needs a new add_message?

messages should help the player:
  1. find the package
    -> change lookmode to chat
    -> when no one is near you, add a message to the log like "stick it to the man" 
    -> when another skater is nearby, they respond with a message telling the player where the package is 
  2. find the recipient
    -> same as above, with:
      -> nearby skaters that have seen the recipient will respond with a message that colors a noun with the color of the
      recipient (recipient will only be colored once the player has found a skater who has seen them)

Game Loop
  1. Find package
    spawn player
    spawn package
  2. Deliver package to ai
    spawn many ai's
