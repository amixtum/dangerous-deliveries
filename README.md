If you have Rust installed already just type:

    cargo run

Otherwise install Rust first

How to play:

* Look = ';' (Press a direction key to look in that direction)

* Move Left = 'h' or 'a'

* Move Right = 'l' or 'd'

* Move Up = 'k' or 'w'

* Move Down = 'j' or 's'

* Move Northwest = 'y' or 'q'

* Move Northeast = 'u' or 'e'

* Move Southwest = 'b' or 'z'

* Move Southeast = 'n' or 'c'

* Wait = '.' or Tab

* Restart = Enter

* Exit = Esc

Don't fall over (or into a bottomless pit of spikes)!
